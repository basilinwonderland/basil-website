                    <p><strong>welcome to my website!</strong></p>
                    <p>Fandom lover of Danganronpa, Omori, Promise Neverland, and FNAF! I enjoy gardening, theatre, photography, and plants. Just a heads up, I'm hypersexual and tend to make sexual jokes and playful death threats. If that's not your cup of tea, feel free to not interact. My "do not interact" list includes individuals over 18, pedophiles, and intimidating folks I encounter in real life.</p>
