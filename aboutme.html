                    <p><strong>nice to meet you again!</strong></p>
                    <p>Greetings! I'm an avid fan of Danganronpa, Omori, Promise Neverland, and FNAF. Apart from these captivating fandoms, I have a genuine love for gardening, theatre, photography, and all things related to plants.</p>
                    <p>However, it's worth mentioning that I am hypersexual and often indulge in making sexual jokes and playful death threats. If this kind of humor doesn't sit well with you, I kindly request that you refrain from interacting with me. </p>
                    <p>Additionally, my "do not interact" list encompasses people over the age of 18, pedophiles, and the intimidating individuals I might come across in real life. Thank you for your understanding.</p>
                    <p>here's what i look like!</a>)</p>
